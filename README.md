# 🎵 Analyzing Spotify Data Using SQL

## 📊 Project Overview

This project dives into the exploration and analysis of a comprehensive Spotify dataset using SQL. With a focus on solving real-world business problems, it demonstrates how SQL—especially when used with PostgreSQL—can be a powerful tool for extracting actionable insights from music streaming data.

Whether you're identifying underperforming tracks, analyzing artist performance, or ranking songs based on energy and popularity, this project covers 15+ distinct use cases that range from basic to advanced SQL operations.

-- create table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS spotify;
CREATE TABLE spotify (
    artist VARCHAR(255),
    track VARCHAR(255),
    album VARCHAR(255),
    album_type VARCHAR(50),
    danceability FLOAT,
    energy FLOAT,
    loudness FLOAT,
    speechiness FLOAT,
    acousticness FLOAT,
    instrumentalness FLOAT,
    liveness FLOAT,
    valence FLOAT,
    tempo FLOAT,
    duration_min FLOAT,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    channel VARCHAR(255),
    views FLOAT,
    likes BIGINT,
    comments BIGINT,

    stream BIGINT,
    energy_liveness FLOAT,
    most_played_on VARCHAR(50)
);

## 🎯 Objectives

By completing this project, you will learn to:

* Import and manage large datasets in PostgreSQL using PGAdmin 4
* Clean and prepare raw data for efficient querying
* Apply key SQL concepts, including:

  * `GROUP BY` & Aggregation
  * Subqueries & Joins
  * Window Functions (e.g., `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`)
  * Performance tuning with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`
  * Indexing for query optimization

---

## 🧱 Project Structure

### 1. Data Acquisition

* Download the dataset from Kaggle:
  👉 [Spotify Dataset 1921–2020, 160k+ Tracks](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsumat/spotify-top-2000s-mega-dataset)

* Import the CSV into a PostgreSQL database using PGAdmin or `COPY` commands

### 2. Data Preparation

* Create tables with accurate data types (`VARCHAR`, `FLOAT`, `BIGINT`, etc.)
* Handle missing values and clean inconsistencies (especially in `likes`, `views`, and `comments`)
* Remove invalid entries (e.g., tracks with zero duration)

### 3. SQL Table Creation

* SQL scripts for schema creation are provided in the repository
* Use the `CREATE TABLE` scripts to define the data model

### 4. Data Analysis & Insights

* Perform SQL-based analysis to answer 15+ business questions:

  * How many songs are released by each artist?
  * Which tracks have the highest energy levels?
  * What is the difference in energy between top-streamed songs?
  * How do views vary across album types?
  * Which songs have the longest/shortest duration?

### 5. Query Optimization

* Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to review query performance
* Add appropriate indexes to speed up queries on large datasets

---

## ✨ Key Features

* Advanced SQL implementations for business-focused use cases
* Dataset exploration based on album types, artist metrics, and streaming data
* Use of window functions to derive rankings and insights
* Hands-on performance improvement using indexing
* Clean and modular SQL scripts for easy reuse

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites

* PostgreSQL (latest version recommended)
* PGAdmin 4 (optional but recommended for GUI interaction)
* Working knowledge of SQL (basic to intermediate level)

### 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Download the Dataset**
   Access the dataset on Kaggle:
   📎 [Spotify Dataset 1921–2020, 160k+ Tracks](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsumat/spotify-top-2000s-mega-dataset)

2. **Set Up PostgreSQL Database**
   Create a new database using PGAdmin 4 or CLI.

3. **Run Table Creation Scripts**
   Use the SQL scripts provided in the `/scripts` folder to define your schema.

4. **Clean & Import the Data**
   Clean the CSV file (remove blanks, fix data types), and import it into your database.

5. **Start Querying!**
   Execute the sample queries or write your own to uncover patterns and insights.
